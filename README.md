#BMP180
##Arduino Pressure Sensor Library
###Developed for the Space Systems Laboratory at the University of Maryland

This is a heavily simplified Arduino library for BMP180 Bosch barometric pressure/temperature sensors, forked from LowPowerLab and Sparkfun. 
If you need more functionality than just "getPressure" and "getTemperature" then try cloning those other BMP180 repositories instead (https://github.com/LowPowerLab/SFE_BMP180.git)

##Installation
Copy this folder into your_arduino_workspace/libraries/ and use the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to include and upload
